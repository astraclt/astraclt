		Through an analysis of Robert Eggers’ The VVitch: A New England Folktale (2015), I want to examine how the materiality of earth and air has a special role to play in folk horror. My contention is that mood in the cinema often involves a making visible of the air and that The VVitch is particularly invested in moody, imaginative interminglings between air, atmosphere and the environment. Set in 1630s New England, The VVitch tells the story of a devout English Puritan family who are beset by witchcraft and satanic possession. Following a theological dispute with the local Puritan community, William (Ralph Innerson) relocates his family to a remote region; however, nothing will grow in the bleak surrounds. Before they venture out into the forest in search of food, William assures his eldest son Caleb (Harvey Scrimshaw) that they “will conquer this wilderness … it will not consume us”. As the vision of the camera drifts slowly towards the forest, clanging sounds foretell danger. This is not a wilderness that will be conquered or owned.

		In the second quotation that heads this article, Béla Balázs intimates that landscape in film (be it alluring, mysterious, magical, demonic or otherwise) reveals a non-human sensuality. For Balázs, as well as many other early theorists of mood, “landscapes, objects, [and] architecturally designed spaces all possess character and mood”. [4] Returning to the importance of mood in early film theory (by way of thinkers such as Georg Simmel, Balázs, Jean Epstein and Lotte H. Eisner), I note a recurring concern with the non-human materiality of mood, illustrated by focusing on landscape and environment as well as manifestations of air on-screen.
